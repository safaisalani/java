java code -->  compiler (javac) --> byte code --> jre & lib --> jvm



    JDK (Java Development Kit):
        The JDK is a software development kit that provides the tools and resources necessary for developing Java applications.
        It includes the Java compiler (javac) to compile Java source code into bytecode.
        It also includes various development tools, libraries, and documentation.

    Compilation:
        When you write Java source code (.java files) using a text editor, you can use the JDK's Java compiler (javac) to compile the source code.
        The compiler converts the human-readable Java code into platform-independent bytecode (.class files), which contains instructions for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

    JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
        The JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode.
        It is responsible for interpreting and executing the bytecode instructions of a Java program.
        The JVM provides a runtime environment that abstracts the underlying hardware and operating system, allowing Java programs to be platform-independent.
        The JVM also handles memory management, garbage collection, and other runtime operations.

    JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
        The JRE is an implementation of the JVM along with the required libraries and resources to run Java applications.
        It includes the JVM, class libraries, and other files necessary for executing Java programs.
        The JRE is designed for end-users who only need to run Java applications, not develop them.
